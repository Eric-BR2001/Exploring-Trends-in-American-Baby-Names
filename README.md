# Exploring-Trends-in-American-Baby-Names
What makes a name timeless or trendy? This project uses over a century of U.S. Social Security data to explore American baby name preferences.  The data manipulation skills you'll use in this project are broadly applicable: understanding changing tastes is a key competency for businesses as well as parents searching for a baby name!
